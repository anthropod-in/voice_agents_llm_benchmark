They'll be doing a technical deep dive into the best practices for building a state-of-the-art inference stack for voice AI.

Second, to learn more about reliable agents, I'd recommend **"Ship it! Building Production-Ready Agents"** by Mike Chambers. This talk is on June 5th at 12:15 PM and will cover the practical challenges and solutions for deploying AI agents in real-world production environments.
